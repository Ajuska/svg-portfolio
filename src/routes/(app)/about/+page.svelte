<Header title="Hi, I'm Andrea Vicarova"></Header>
<p>
	Ever since my childhood, I have been captivated by art in every form: paper, clay, plastic,
	clothes, sound, and eventually, bits. I would never have thought that computers could make those
	beeping sounds when dialing for an internet connection. Are they alive? Can they hear us? Maybe
	not, but fast forward, they can definitely fix any issues in this message for me.

	I'm thrilled that I can speak several human languages, but my brain has also picked up the grammar
	for those metal machines, allowing me to understand at least a fraction of what is there to grasp.
	Perhaps itâ€™s already clear to you that I'm a huge sci-fi fan with a vivid imagination. Currently,
	I channel this creativity into crafting pixel-perfect, accessible products for the web or game
	development.
